# -Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-Scikit-Learn

It codes shows the steps taking to train a model to predict employee turnover rate using #DECISION TREE & RANDOM FOREST

# -STEPS TAKEN ARE:
1. Importing the dataset
2. EDA
3. Encoding
4. Virtualize Class Imbalance
5. Split into train and test set
6. Build an Interactive Decision Tree Classify
7. Build an Interactive Random Forest Classify 
8. Feauture Importance 
9. Evaluation Metric

## Problems you might encounter
The codes were run on RHYME, it was a project-based course I took on cousera. So, I do not know how to run Jupyter Interactive Widget as at the time writing all these. And by so doing, I am so much open to know that, so please comment.
